        <p>Description</p>
        <p>
          Contrary to other forms of high velocity ammunition, this type of
          ammunition deals less damage than ordinary rockets. While High
          Velocity Rockets are not encouraged for use in damaging structures,
          they serve a special function in Player vs. Player engagements and
          damaging vehicles. High velocity rockets used to be able to be
          salvaged at the Recycler for explosives and gunpowder. This used to
          provide a player with an easy way to acquire an explosive for
          research. This is no longer possible as High velocity rockets no
          longer require explosives to craft. Explosives were removed from the
          ingredients as of the Transport Helicopter Update.

        <p>Description</p>
        <p>
          Elite Tier Crates can be found at the Launch Site, Military Tunnels
          and the Oil Rig monuments. These crates contain loot that tends to be
          more rare than red toolboxes and military crates. These crates when
          compared to the military crates may be about the same in loot quantity
          and items but they may also contain more items than military crates,
          it really just depends but chances are elite crates will contain more
          loot than any other crate. The elite crate has a 15 minute spawn rate,
          and at the launch site, can be found 1 to 2 times in one run.
